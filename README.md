# Feasibility Study Company — Website

Static marketing site for Feasibility Study Company, an independent feasibility and
market-study practice serving lenders and investors (SBA, USDA, EB-5, HUD-FHA, and
conventional institutional capital).

```

The site is intentionally launched with four published pages; primary-nav links to
forthcoming sections (other states, asset classes, practice areas) resolve to the
branded `404.html` until those pages ship. Add each page to `sitemap.xml` as it goes live.

## Deployment

Hosted on **Netlify**, deployed from this repository. Every push to the default
branch triggers an automatic deploy. No build step — the repository root is served
as static assets, and `netlify/functions/` is deployed as serverless functions.

- Build command: *(none)*
- Publish directory: **/** (repository root)
- Functions directory: **netlify/functions**

### Contact form

The footer contact form posts to `/api/contact`, which `netlify.toml` rewrites to
the `contact` function. That function relays the message via the **Resend** email
API. Set these environment variables in Netlify (Site settings → Environment
variables) for the form to send:

| Name | Example |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_...` (mark as secret) |
| `CONTACT_TO` | `info@feasibility-study-company.com` |
| `CONTACT_FROM` | `Feasibility Study Company <inquiries@feasibility-study-company.com>` |

The sending domain must be verified in Resend. See `DEPLOYMENT-contact-form.md`
(in the original package) for the full email setup.

### NDA generator

`/tools/nda/` is a fully client-side one-way NDA generator (jsPDF). Nothing is
transmitted or stored; it needs no backend. The page is `noindex`.
